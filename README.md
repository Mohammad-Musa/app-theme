##  `app-theme`


> ###### This project is a bout building a new website starting from the scratch for a fictional web design company.  

> ###### The purpose of this project is to practice on the below tools and concepts in order to familiarize ourselves with them:
* Writing `a clean code`, we will make this code clear and understandable not only by the computer byt also by the human.
* Using `Bootstrap` framework which will usdesign websites faster and easier.
* Using layout moudels like css `Flexbox` and css `Grid`, they allow us to create complex layouts that were previously only possible by applying CSS hacks and/or JavaScript.
* Creating an `issue` per branch and close it after implementing the new feature by using closing keywords in the commit message. 
* Using `git branch` to add a nwe feature to our project.
* Using `user stories` which is a tool in [**`Agile`**](https://www.perforce.com/resources/hns/agile-development-explained-agile-developer) software development and describe it in a file called `development-strategy`. This tool will be used to understand the software feature from the end user's perspective, it describes user type, what that user wants, and why.
